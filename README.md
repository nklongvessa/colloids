This is a collection of python scripts for processing and analysing experimental (or simulation) data on colloidal particles.
In both 'tracking' and 'analysis' folder, there are two options for 'csv' and 'h5'.
'csv' is for processing using .csv extension. It is suitable when there are no too many particles.
'h5' is for the HDF5 data format.
